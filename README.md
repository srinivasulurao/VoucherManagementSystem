# VoucherManagementSystem

This project is voucher redemption platform, using this platform store owners can distribute the vouchers to their customers to sell their products.

**How It Works**

Store owner need to register to the platform <br>
Store owners need to add product and its details with possible specifications of the product into the system<br>
Store need to upload vouchers into the system, each voucher should be linked to a particular product<br>
Store owner will give this code to their clients, if they are interested to buy any particular product.
Our platform will generate a javascript code, which the store owner can ember into their site.
The customer will come to the page where the code is embed, the embed code is basically a FORM where the customer can add his vouchers.
Once the customer adds the voucher in the form textbox, our system will pull the corresponding product details linked to the voucher.
The form will immeditately turn into a e-commerce cart, where he can complete the order.
The store owner will get the order details into our system and he needs to deliver the product to the customer to his address.

THAT's IT, SO SIMPLE.
